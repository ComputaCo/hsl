# Browser: Google search

This process streamlines the task of retrieving information from the web based on a user's query, covering various content types like text, images, news, and videos. It is designed to efficiently collect data or references pertinent to a specific topic.

## Input

- `searchQuery: text` - The user-provided query to search for. This is the main input from the user.
- `contentType: text` - Default is "General". Specifies the content type to be searched options like "General", "Images", "News", "Videos".
- `count: number` - Default is 10. The quantity of search results the user requests.

## Output

- `searchResults: table` - A compilation of search results, detailing titles, links, snippets and content types

## Steps

1. Open the search page at `https://google.com`.
2. In the search box `[search box]`, enter your query `searchQuery`.
3. Initiate the search by clicking `[search button]`.
4. If `contentType` is not "General":
   - Look for `[contentType tab/button]`. If it exists, select it to filter results accordingly.
   - Otherwise, note that the specific content type is not available.
5. Set a variable `resultsCollected` to 0 for tracking the number of results.
6. Collect results until reaching `count`:
   - Find `[titles]`, `[links]` and `[snippets]` in `[results area]` and add them to `searchResults`.
   - Update `resultsCollected` with the number of items found.
   - If `resultsCollected` is less than `count`, proceed to the next page by `[scroll]` for more results.
7. Finalize the search by organizing all collected information into `searchResults`.
